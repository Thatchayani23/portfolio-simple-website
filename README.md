# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It includes two main pages: the **Home** page, which introduces me and showcases my skills, and the **Contact** page, which allows visitors to reach out to me for collaborations or inquiries.

## Features

- **Home Page**: An introduction to who I am, my skills, and my professional background.
- **Contact Page**: A section with a contact form to facilitate easy communication with me.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is designed to be mobile-friendly and looks great on all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the content of both pages.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
